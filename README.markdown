# Onion Notebooks

This is my collection of various Jupyter notebooks that I use in relationship
with my work at The Tor Project.

## Installation

1. Start by creating a virtual environment with Python 3 using:

    $ virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3.8 env

2. Enter the virtual environment:

    $ . env/bin/activate

3. Install the dependencies:

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Open the Jupyter notebook that you are interested in working with.
